# Bitburner Sync

This package allows code to be synced to the game from any environment. It's inspired by
the [VSCode extension](https://github.com/bitburner-official/bitburner-vscode) but allows for greater freedom since it's
not tied to a specific IDE. The only requirement is [Node.jsÂ®](https://nodejs.org).

NB: You must play the game via the Electron client (the Steam version) to be able to sync code.

## Install

Install in your project via `npm install bitburner-sync`. It can be installed as a global tool  but it then looses the ability to be configured in package.json.

## Usage

Can be used from the terminal. Use `bitburner-sync -help` for full information.

| Option     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| authToken  | The only required option, it can also be read from package.json. See the [VSCode extension](https://github.com/bitburner-official/bitburner-vscode) for information about how to retrieve it.                                                |
| scriptRoot | The folder that you want to sync. Defaults to the current folder. The directory node_modules is ignored but any other valid game files are synced. It's highly recommended to do a dryRun first to list all the files that would be synced.  |
| dryRun     | Doesn't sync the files, simply lists them in the terminal.                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| watch      | Continuously monitor the scriptRoot for changes                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| help       | Displays the full help                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

### package.json

  "sync": "bitburner-sync --watch"
}
```

Optional config

````json
"config": {
