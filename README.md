# Bitburner Sync

This package allows code to be synced to the game from any environment. It's inspired by
the [VSCode extension](https://github.com/bitburner-official/bitburner-vscode) but allows for greater freedom since it's
not tied to a specific IDE. The only requirement is [Node.jsÂ®](https://nodejs.org).

NB: You must play the game via the Electron client (aka the Steam version) to be able to sync code.

## Install

Install in your project via `npm install bitburner-sync`.

It can also be installed as a global tool via `npm install bitburner-sync -g`.

For more help around installation then look [here](https://github.com/Nezrahm/bitburner-sync/wiki/Installation)

## Usage

Can be used from the terminal, then always prefix the calls with `npx`. Use `npx bitburner-sync --help` for full information.

| Option      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| authToken   | The only required option, it can also be read from package.json. See the installation instruction above or the [VSCode extension](https://github.com/bitburner-official/bitburner-vscode) for information about how to retrieve it.         |
| scriptRoot  | The folder that you want to sync. Defaults to the current folder. The directory node_modules is ignored but any other valid game files are synced. It's highly recommended to do a dryRun first to list all the files that would be synced. |
| serverUrl   | The API server (game client) to connect to (defaults to a local application, 127.0.0.1)                                                                                                                                                     |
| allowDelete | If the sync (upload and retrieve) should be allowed to delete files at the target                                                                                                                                                           |
| get         | Retrieve files from bitburner and store at scriptRoot                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| dryRun      | Doesn't sync the files, simply lists them in the terminal.                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| watch       | Continuously monitor the scriptRoot for changes.                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| help        | Displays the full help.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

### package.json

It's recommended to be configured as a script that can then be invoked via `npm run sync` or similar.

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "sync": "bitburner-sync --watch"
  }
}
```

Optional config

```json
{
  "config": {
    "bitburnerAuthToken": "abc",
    "bitburnerScriptRoot": "./dist",
    "bitburnerAllowDelete": "false",
    "bitburnerServerUrl": "127.0.0.1"
  }
}
```

### bitburner-sync.json

This is another config file, if you prefer to have the config separate from the package.json file.

NB: The config inside package.json will override this config if both are specified.

```json
{
  "authToken": "abc",
  "scriptRoot": "./dist",
  "allowDelete": false,
  "serverUrl": "127.0.0.1"
} 
```
